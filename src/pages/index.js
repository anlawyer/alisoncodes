      <h3>Bento for Business</h3>
      <p>
        Bento is a financial operating platform focusing on providing value to
        small and medium business by giving owners control over their expenses.
        Day to day, I work on all frontend projects using React and Redux.
      </p>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        I studied Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley, and did two software
        engineering bootcamps after graduating from Cal in 2017. I worked full
        time while studying part time to become a web developer and was hired by
        Bento in mid-2018.
      </p>

      <h3>I'm like other things too</h3>
      <p>
        I also enjoy rock climbing, city biking, traveling to other cities to
        ride their transit, and going outdoors when I can. When I'm not reading
        a Vonnegut book, I like to learn about humans, psychology, design, and
        civic technology.
