        <h1>Hi, I'm Alison and this is my website.</h1>
        I'm a frontend developer living in Oakland, CA. I work at a FinTech
        startup in San Francisco, and I spend my free time volunteering for Code
        for America at the OpenOakland brigade where I lead the brigade's
        communication efforts. I also do indoor rock climbing, city biking, and
        like to travel to other cities and outdoors locations when I can. I
        studies Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley, and did two software
        engineering bootcamps after graduating in 2017. I like to learn and read
        about humans, psychology, design, and civic technology.
